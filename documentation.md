# Documentation Lab 3 - Killian Serluppens

## Description
- I made a turf application to control and view how many drinks you have bought
- It uses a form on the home page to fill it in, and you can view your turfs on the seconds page. I am planning to add a settings page zhere you can change it into dark mode but i have not completeted that at the time of writing

## Intro
- For My GUI i used the tabs templated from ionic
- I reused some code of my 2nd lab but I redit andchanged some parts
  - Like a new form and a added code for an overview page

## Steps Followed

### Step 1 - Instalation
- For the instalation proses I used the documentation on canvas. I did have a problem when i want to use electron auto-reload (npm start / ionic serve)
  - In the tutorial you have to at './' to the index.html page in the base tag. when i use this i get a MIME error. 
  - So i deleded this and wrote just '/' when i am desinign the UI

### Step 2 - UI
- The UI is simple
  - I have 3 pages (tabs)
  - i used the tab templated from ionic
  - the home page (tab1) is the page where the form is and where you can fill in a turf
  - the overview page (tab2) is the oage where you can view all of your turfs
  - the settings page (tab3) is where you can change some settings

### Step 3 - IPC 
- This setp is adding IPC to the project
